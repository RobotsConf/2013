<h2 class="featurette-heading mtop">Teams and Projects</h2>
<p>RobotsConf was absolutely amazing and it was all thanks to the wonderful attendees that gathered together and create a vast amount of incredible projects. We wanted to pull together a list of all of the teams and their resulting projects (as well as any pictures and notes they might have). Please find the list of projects completed in just under 16 hours below. If you attended, but don't see your project listed, please <a href="https://github.com/RobotsConf/2013">submit an issue/pull request here</a>.</p>

  <div class='description'>@FloatBot was an interactive RobotsConf2013 project that allowed attendees to tweet driving commands to our robot in the form "@FloatBot FFPLFRBPS". Query services polled Twitter for new commands and passed them along wirelessly to a simple robot built on top of a Parallax chassis with an Arduino-compatible Spark Core as the brains.
