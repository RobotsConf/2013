			<div class='title'>Modules, what are they good for?</div>
			<p>Have you ever started developing a simple application that only had one or two JavaScript files, and after a short time, you had over a dozen different scripts that you were loading, and if the sequence was even slightly off, things went awry? Everyone hits this point eventually, and the solution is modules!</p>

<p>In this session, we'll introduce what a module is and why it matters to you. There are many benefits to modular code development, and we'll cover those at an introductory level. We'll also take a look over the past, present, and future of modules in JavaScript. By the time we're done, you'll have a solid foundation to take away and put to use in your application!</p>

<p>Topics to be covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why modules matter: Write more easily managed, DRYer, testable code</li>
<li>A history of module patterns: How people used to do this in JS</li>
<li>What's hot now: CJS &amp; AMD, including how to use each today</li>
<li>The future: ES6 modules</li>
</ul>

			<div class='title'>Getting Started with Backbone.JS (or some variant)</div>
			<p>These days, it's hard to build a modern web application without using an MVC framework to modularize and structure your JavaScript code. But if you've never used a JavaScript MVC framework or worked with a RESTful architecture, it can be hard to wrap your head around this new way of doing things.
In this workshop, we will introduce Backbone.JS, one of the most popular JS MVC frameworks in use today, and then we'll actually write some code to implement Backbone models and views to interact with an API backend. We'll conclude with real-world uses of Backbone and lessons learnt.</p>

			<div class='title'>Learning Node.js</div>
			<p>A hands-on on-boarding to Node.js focused on teaching you the essentials of how Node.js works thru code: Callback vs. Streams, How node core remains minimal with npm and user-land, What does Node core do for you (focused on network protocols). Finally we put it all together with a sample app and discuss performance implications of real-life Node.js production applications.</p>

			<div class='title'>Understanding the Misunderstood Parts of JavaScript</div>
			<p>You will leave this training with a very good conceptual understanding of the most misunderstood parts of JS. After many years of training people on JavaScript, I've learned to approach training difficult topics from a variety of approaches.  For prototypal inheritance, I will:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>walk through multiple examples</li>
			<li>visually diagram what JS is doing in memory</li>
			<li>Write a JS implementation of the DOT (.) and NEW (new) operators</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Not everyone learns the same way.  Explaining a concept in multiple ways results in much better retention. I also keep things fun by using humorous examples and bringing a lot of energy on what is typically dry material.</p>
