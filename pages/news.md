## [Changing the Game - Results Of #15ForAda](/5kforada)

[JSConf US 2013](http://2013.jsconf.us) attendees and organizers raised $5,000 for the Ada Initiative, who advised the organizers on how to attract more women and improve diversity overall. Attendees contributed $2,550 directly, and the JSConf organizational team matched 50% of attendee donations, as well as donating a further $1,175 to bring the total to $5,000. The JSConf organizers hope to set a strong precedent for other conferences by becoming an active agent for positive social change.

## [JSConf US 2013 Tickets](/how-to-ticket)

One of the most exciting and often complained about items of JSConf is the scarcity of tickets and the process of procuring them. This is a natural problem that occurs with each successful year of running JSConf as more people both become interested in JS and aware of JSConf. This year we are trying out a completely new way of registering for tickets for JSConf US 2103.
