## [RobotsConf Call for Makers and Maker-Makers](/call-for-speakers)

RobotsConf will be an extraordinary event driven mainly by our industry experts that are selected to attend as speakers. We want you to be those industry experts! We want to hear from you about the amazing things you are doing, building, making, and thinking! We do have specific topic areas we are looking for as well as specific hands-on trainers we would like to have as invited participants, so please review the list below for what is needed. At the same time, please don't limit your submissions to JUST those topics, we are happy to entertain any crazy idea - so long as you can tailor to an audience of software developers learning hardware. For all submissions (speaker or trainers), we are looking for training and speaking expertise balanced with "incredibleness" of topic, all of that must be tempered with an ability to present in an educational versus simply presentational manner. In short, we want people who have done/are doing amazing things, can speak to those things in an accessible manner, and help people to recreate it on their own.
