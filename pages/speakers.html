			<div class='title'>Meet Whurley</div>
	<p>He's been called a visionary systems theorist, a mad scientist, and an evil genius (International Genius).  What he is, is innovative.  Over his 20-year career, whurley has demonstrated a talent for innovation and a passion for open source software.  In 2010 he co-founded Chaotic Moon, a leading mobile development and strategy company, and quickly built a portfolio of A-list clients.  Names like Microsoft, CBS Sports, Sanrio, Pizza Hutt, and News Corp, for whom Chaotic Moon developed the first iPad-only digital newspaper. </p>
	<p>In 2011 he could have stood put.  Instead he doubled down, helping launch Chaotic Moon Labs to focus on "innovation on demand." As General Manager of the lab in 2012, he created what Wired Magazine described as "the best of CES," an all-terrain skateboard controlled by hand motions.  Powered by an Xbox Kinect&trade; and a Samsung tablet, the board achieved an exhilarating top speed of 32 mph. For dessert, he built a mind-controlled version that Jason Bradbury, host of the Europe's The Gadget Show, said was "...like something out of a science fiction movie" and "comic book crazy." </p>
	<p>He then created a rapid prototype of the shopping cart of the future. The Smarter Cart™ not only guided customers to items at Whole Foods' flagship store, it also scanned their food to help manage their dietary needs, notify them of FDA food recalls, and accelerate their check-out.</p>
	<p>Today whurley keeps the world's top brands decades ahead of the curve, predicting not only the next iteration, but delivering on the demands of the next generation.</p>

			<div class='title'>Meet Sylvia</div>
			<p>"Super-Awesome” Sylvia Todd started making and tinkering with things when she was 7, and always loved to try out new things. One year after visiting Maker Faire, she and her dad were inspired to create a web-show about making things called “Sylvia’s Super-Awesome Maker Show”, where she shows kids and adults that making things can be fun, easy, and more rewarding than just buying something purpose built. Now 12 years old and millions of views later, she’s covered everything from hobby rocketry, to sewable soft circuits, to Arduino. The show has garnered attention from parents and educators the world over, finding that something about the show gets students interested in making things and learning something along the way. In July 2013, she successfully launched her very first educational robotic kit on Kickstarter, the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1894919479/super-awesome-sylvias-watercolorbot-0">WaterColorBot</a>.

			<div class='title'>Meet Todd</div>
			<p>Though James Todd has always been a tinkerer, he started his family early and somehow figured that it wasn't something he could continue with his young children. After a visit to Maker Faire, it was clear that family life and electronics, programming and making this wasn't just possible, but should be encouraged at every step. Eventually working with his oldest daughter Sylvia at the age of 8, they decided to create a youtube video in the style of a show about building a kit, and take it back to maker faire. The video became an overnight success, and after only a year had blossomed into a second life, sending his family across the country to talk about the wonders of making. Though he's never been to college, and didn't even finish high school, he writes code for fun and profit, and tries his best to share as much as he has time for at <a href="http://github.com/techninja">github.com/techninja</a>.</p>

      <div class='title'>Meet Marc</div>
      <p>I thrive on complexity.</p>

<!-- <p>I'm a Senior Program Manager at Microsoft, my primary focus is on project and release management. Most recently I was involved in shipping .NET 4.5.1 and the Azure SDK for .NET 2.2.</p> -->

  <p>I got involved outside of work in 3D printing in early 2011. I found a lot of help in this from other people I knew at work who had been involved in it longer. The higher in person bandwidth communication was much more useful than internet resources. Lacking a place to get together after work I made one, the Maker Garage Chapter. As such its scope is broader than just 3D printing. The Maker Garage is a place where employees can work on their hardware projects, related to work or not. It’s a place to share knowledge, tools and inspiration. We’ve grown a lot over the past two years and opened a Maker Space at work this year. Outside of work I’ve also been involved in alpha build verification for a successful 3D printer Kickstarter, the Kossel Pro. I also love woodworking and audio synthesis. Someday I’ll bring those together and build that modular synthesizer.</p>

    <div class='talk'>
      <div class='title'>Workshop: Microcontrollers and the Internet of Things (IoT)</div>
        </div>
    <div class='bio'>
      <div class='title'>Meet Chris</div>
      <p>I am a software developer by day, hardware hacker by night.  Over the last two years I've shipped production systems, installed two internet-enabled arduino projects in the Heroku office (where I work), and built a Websockets-based demo of the Internet of Things at scale. <br/><br/>
      My passion specifically for microcontrollers and the Internet of Things stems from work I did in college teaching computer science via Lego Mindstorms. I helped design college-level coursework for the entire CSC cirriculum, from systems labs to AI labs.  I believe microcontrollers are the perfect way to demonstrate the practical power of computing to interact with the physical world.<br/><br/>
      Now that I am a professional engineer, I have been channeling that work into bringing high-level languages and concepts to the newest generation of internet-enabled devices.  I've built an HTTP library for Arduino so that I can more easily consume REST endpoints.  I've extended libraries on the Arduino and RasPI to add features I've needed for projects.<br/><br/>
      And while I love to get lost in the details, I have the discipline to step back and try to get others excited in the new world of possibilities afforded by ubiquitous computing.</p>

      <p>I completed a degree in Cognitive Science. While doing so I participated in graduate level robotics courses (as an undergrad) and also went on to to compete in the Rochard Tapia Conference for Diversity in Computing Science robotics competition in 2007 - our team came in 2nd overall, as well as won the coveted Technical Achievement award for our collision avoidance algorithm.<br/><br/>Although I transitioned to a full time web developer since graduating (I work at Mozilla now), I am still an avid hobby roboticist in my spare time and I look forward to integrating as much sensor data as I can from the real world as I can possible get away with. My current project is to re-create a smaller, more agile version of the robot our team built years ago and to replicate our collision avoidance algorithm using Javascript for use with Johnny 5</p>

      <p>Susan Hinton is a web developer by day, and hobby enthusiast by night. She's currently heavily immersed in the 3D printing scene, teaching and enabling others in the technology. Her latest weapon of choice is a Printrbot Jr, which has been tricked out with upgrades and experiments. In 2011, she released a 3D printed jewelry range at <a href="http://owlposse.com/">http://owlposse.com</a>. Her idea of an ideal Friday night is 3D modeling jewelry and robots, accompanied by a glass or two of quality scotch. As a board member of SYN Shop the Las Vegas hackerspace, Susan maintains the rapid prototyping station there. She also runs a newsletter called 3D Print Weekly over at <a href="http://3dprintweekly.com/">3dprintweekly.com</a>. She's probably attempting to 3D print a cat right now.</p>
